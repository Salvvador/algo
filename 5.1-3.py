'''
Suppose that you want to output 0 with probability 1/2 and 1 with probability 1/2. At your disposal is a procedure
BIASED-RANDOM that outputs either 0 or 1. It outputs 1 with some probability p and 0 with probability 1âˆ’p, where 0<p<1,
but you don't now what p is. Give an algorithm that uses BIASED-RANDOM as a subroutine, and returns an unbiased answer,
returning 0 with probability 1/2 and 1 with probability 1/2. What is the expected running time of your algorithm as a
function of p?
