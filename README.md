# Algo

In this repository, I put my solutions to some of the FANG-like interview questions (FANG = Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google). 
I draw those questions from the following sources:

[Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844), 
by Thomas H. Cormen et al.

[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850), 
by Gayle L. McDowell

I solve those problems to get better with algorithms and data structures. 
I aim at correctness and the lowest asymptotic complexity. 
I try not to spend more than one hour on each exercise. 
I don't focus much on code readability.  
I always pick Python during such interviews, as I think it is great for solving this type of problems. 
However, I don't have any commercial experience in Python and I'm quite sure that some of the solutions 
in this repo could have been done in a slightly 'cleaner' way.  
**So, If you came here while looking for solutions to those exercises, I highly recommend you to look for them elsewhere.**
